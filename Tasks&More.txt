Olivia- 




Pratyush - I wanted to have 3 sides of this application, 
- One is Seller side( the person who has some electricity units or tokens stored in meter), 
- One is government side who only approves the transaction , 
- last is buyer side which buys the electricity units, 
- All this transaction happens through blockchain, and a smart contract is deployed whenenver the transaction is completed. 
- A pop up comes, which directly redirects to metamask, and there the contract gets deployed. 

Seller and buyer side= name, email,contact, transaction id, connection number, state and city of electricity supplier( in future, we can add map, *probabily secondary phase of project)

Major API usage- Metamask( tension nakko, i'll elaborate it)

Lib- Web3.js, Ether.js, Ethereum for contract deployement
